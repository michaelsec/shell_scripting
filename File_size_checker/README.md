File Size Checker
This is a bash script that prompts the user to enter a file path and checks if the file exists. If the file exists, it retrieves and displays the size of the file in bytes.

Usage
1. Make sure you have execute permissions for the script: chmod +x file_size_checker_script.sh.
2. Run the script: ./file_size_checker_script.sh.
3. You will be prompted to enter a file path. Provide the full path to the file you want to check and press Enter.
4. The script will check if the file exists and display its size in bytes if it does. If the file is not found, an appropriate error message will be shown.

Prerequisites
This script is intended for Linux and Unix-like systems.
The user executing the script must have sufficient permissions to access the file.

Note
If the file path contains spaces or special characters, make sure to enclose it in quotes when prompted.
